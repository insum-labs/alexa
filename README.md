[Wake Word](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201971890) | What Alexa "listens to" before taking an action. In most cases it will be `Alexa` but can be configured to `Amazon` or `Echo`. | **Alexa** what time is it. In this example `Alexa` is the wake word.
Skill | "App" for Alexa | Complete list of Alexa skills [here](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13727921011). Each one of them are skills.
[Invocation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/choose-the-invocation-name-for-a-custom-skill.html) | Trigger word for skill | ["Alexa, ask CBC for help"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07743SCXC?ref=skillrw_dsk_pnps_dp_2) In this case the invocation is `CBC`. For custom skills invocations should be 2 or more words.

[Utterance](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/best-practices-for-sample-utterances-and-custom-slot-type-values.html) | What follows an invocation to determine intent | "Alexa, ask CBC for help". In this case `for help` would be the utterance. An intent can have multiple utterances.
